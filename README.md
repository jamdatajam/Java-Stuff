# Java-Stuff
	Some programs that I built in Java.
	Mini Project 1 (2017) is a weird hybrid Rogue-eqsque/Pacman-esque game I affectionately refer to as "Pac-Dude." 
	Mini Project 2 (2017) is code to do the monetary math and product tracking for a vending machine. It can be set to work in several different currencies, and the products/stock it contains can be modified.
	Mini Project 3 (2017) is a gui-based mp3 meta-data tracking and editing program.
